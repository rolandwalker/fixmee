;; Version: 0.7.0
;; Last-Updated: 30 Aug 2012
;; EmacsWiki: FixmeeMode
;; Keywords: navigation, convenience

;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Fixmee-mode tracks "fixme" notices in code comments, highlights
;; them, ranks them by urgency, and lets you navigate to them quickly.
;;
;; Urgency of "fixme" notices is indicated by repeating the final
;; character.  For example, one might write "FIXMEEEEEEEEE" for an
;; important issue.
;;
;; Quickstart:
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs
;;
;;     (require 'fixmee)
;;     (global-fixmee-mode 1)
;;
;; Then, open some buffers and right-click on the word "fixme" in a
;; comment
;;
;; or press
;;
;;     C-c f
;;
;; or
;;
;;     M-x fixmee RET
;;
;; Key Bindings:
;;
;; The default key bindings are
;;
;;     C-c f `fixmee-goto-nextmost-urgent'
;;     C-c F `fixmee-goto-prevmost-urgent'
;;     M-n   `fixmee-goto-next-by-position'      ; only when the point is
;;     M-p   `fixmee-goto-previous-by-position'  ; inside a fixme notice
;;
;; When the smartrep package is installed, the "C-c" prefix need not
;; be used for consecutive fixmee-mode keyboard commands.  Instead,
;; just keep pressing "f" (or whichever key you set in customize).
;;
;; There is also a context menu and mouse-wheel bindings on the
;; minor-mode lighter in the modeline:
;;
;;             mouse-1   context menu
;;       wheel-down/up   next/prev by urgency
;;     M-wheel-down/up   next/prev by position
;;
;; Patterns:
;;
;; The following fixme patterns are supported by default:
;;
;;     @@@
;;     XXX             ; only this one is case-sensitive
;;     todo
;;     fixme
;;
;; See Also
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET fixmee RET
;;     M-x customize-group RET nav-flash RET
;;
;; Notes
;;
;;     Currently, only open buffers are searched, not files or
;;     projects.
;;
;; Compatibility and Requirements
;;
;;     Tested only on GNU Emacs version 24.1
;;
;;     Requires button-lock.el
;;
;;     Uses if present: smartrep.el, nav-flash.el, back-button.el
;;
;; Bugs
;;
;;    When comment-start is defined, only the first notice on a line
;;    is lit up by button-lock, though fixme-mode is aware of multiple
;;    notices on a line.  This is worked around for the moment by
;;    stripping these cases from fixmee-notice-list.  Better would be
;;    to add comment-sensitivity logic to button-lock, and remove the
;;    comment-matching section of the regexp passed to button-lock.
;;
;;    Fixmee-maybe-turn-on gets called multiple times when a file
;;    is loaded.
;;
;;    Fixmee-buffer-include-functions may not contain the function
;;    'frame-bufs-associated-p, because a new buffer is not yet
;;    associated with the frame at the time the global mode check
;;    calls fixmee-maybe-turn-on.
;;
;; TODO
;;
;;    Better feedback messages for end-of-list and start-of-list.
;;
;;    Integrate with next-error (make a separate buffer showing hits) -
;;    for first pass at this just send regexp to occur, second pass
;;    build a buffer from the contents of fixmee-notice-list.
;;
;;    Consider changing prefix arg to mean "constrain this command to
;;    the current file".
;;
;;    Bookmark integration? (implicit bookmarking on notices).
;;
;;    Wrap/cycle options on navigation-by-position.
;;
;;    How to get last-command when user does M-x? (smex is not helping
;;    here).  (nth 0 command-history) ?
;;
;;    Navigation can land on line near vertical edge of window -
;;    should respect user settings and scroll in as needed for
;;    context.
;;
;;    Project support.
;;
;;    Some kind of extra comment indicating a notice is to be ignored?
;;    Lead with a backwhack?
